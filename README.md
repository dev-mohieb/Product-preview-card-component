## My process
  I built the structure first, then started styling, but I faced an issue with the structure of the page that made me frustrated. After some time thinking what the issue might be, I tried to put the image in one container, and all the other text/input elements in one container called "everythingelse" and it worked!

### Built with
  - Semantic HTML5 markup
  - CSS custom properties
  - Flexbox

### What I learned
  I learned that correctly structuring my HTML will save me a lot of time and headache. I also learned to use min-width and max-width instead of width so that I can keep everything responsive.

### Continued development
  I will focus more on learning to digest the structure of the design better so that I can create cleaner, more effiecent HTML pages.
